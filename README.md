<h1>WebLocationer</h1>
<h2>The main idea</h2>

The idea of this project is to make a simple way for people to make meetings on the best possible location for everyone by simply
calculating the point which is in the centre of their locations and showing different cafees and restaurants.
For the moment there won't be any further logic in the processing of finding the best location.
In future there will be integrated different varuables for public transport and traffic but for the moment I am building the main logic.

<h2>To do list</h2>

Find way to send users on the data base(Use JQuery)!
